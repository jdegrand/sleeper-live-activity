Construct the payload that starts a Live Activity
The JSON payload for starting a Live Activity with an ActivityKit push notification is similar to the payload you use for updates. However, it comes with the following requirements:

Set the value of the event field to start.

Include an alert in the JSON payload.

Include the attributes-type and attributes keys.

By including an alert in your JSON payload, you make sure a person gets alerted about the started Live Activity and avoid unexpectedly surprising them. The following sample payload starts a Live Activity for devices that aren’t running iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 or later:

{
    "aps": {
        "timestamp": 1234,
        "event": "start",
        "content-state": {
            "currentHealthLevel": 100,
            "eventDescription": "Adventure has begun!"
        },
        "attributes-type": "AdventureAttributes",
        "attributes": {
            "hero": {
                "name": "Power Panda",
                "avatar": "U+1F43C",
                "healthLevel": 100,
                "heroType": "Forest Dweller",
                "healthRecoveryRatePerHour": 0.25,
                "url": "game:///panda",
                "battleCode": "game:///panda/battle",
                "level": 3,
                "exp": 600,
                "bio": "Power Panda loves eating bamboo shoots and leaves."
            }
        },
        "alert": {
            "title": {
                "loc-key": "%@ is on an adventure!",
                "loc-args": [
                    "Power Panda"
                ]
            },
            "body": {
                "loc-key": "%@ found a sword!",
                "loc-args": [
                    "Power Panda"
                ]
            },
            "sound": "chime.aiff"
        }
    }
}
For devices running iOS 18 and iPadOS or later, you can add input-push-channel with the appropriate channel ID to start a Live Activity and listen for updates on a channel. After you send this payload, you can send updates on the channel to update a Live Activity.

       "input-push-channel": "dHN0LXNyY2gtY2hubA==",
       "attributes-type": "AdventureAttributes",
       "attributes": {
           "currentHealthLevel": 100,
           "eventDescription": "Adventure has begun!"
       }
Create a channel ID before you send this payload to a device and ensure that the channel ID is valid. If you send this payload to a device that doesn’t run iOS 18 and later, then the Live Activity will not start.

For devices running iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 or later, you can add input-push-token: 1 to your payload to start a Live Activity and receive a new push token. After you receive a new push token, you can use it to send updates to a Live Activity.

        "input-push-token": 1,
        "attributes-type": "AdventureAttributes",
        "attributes": {
            "currentHealthLevel": 100,
            "eventDescription": "Adventure has begun!"
        }3
