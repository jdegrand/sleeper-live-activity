# How to get these values:

# 2. Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
# 3. Go to Keys section
# 4. Create a new key with "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)" enabled
# 5. Download the .p8 file and note the Key ID
# 6. Your Team ID is visible in the top right of the developer portal

# API Key Security:
# - Generate a secure random string (use a password manager or: openssl rand -hex 32)
# - Keep this secret and don't commit it to version control
# - If not set, API runs in development mode (no authentication)
# - All client requests must include header: X-API-Key: your-secret-api-key-here

# Example:
# APNS_KEY_PATH=/Users/yourname/Documents/AuthKey_1234567890.p8
# APNS_KEY_ID=1234567890
